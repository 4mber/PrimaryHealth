                            e. intensive case management includes the following:<br>

                            <p>Outpatient behavioral health services are psychiatric and biopsychosocial assessment, medication management, individual, group, and family therapies, psychotherapy for crisis, and psychological testing for eligible beneficiaries.<br><br>

                            These services are intended to determine a beneficiary’s treatment needs, and to provide the necessary treatment. Services focus on reducing psychiatric and behavioral symptoms in order to improve the beneficiary’s functioning in familial, social, educational, or occupational life domains.<br><br>

                            Outpatient behavioral health services are available to eligible beneficiaries and often involve the participation of family members, significant others, and legally responsible person(s) as applicable, unless contraindicated.<br><br>

                            Based on collaboration between the practitioner and beneficiary, and others as needed, the beneficiary’s needs and preferences determine the treatment goals, frequency and duration of services, as well as measurable and desirable outcomes.<br><br></p>

                            <h3>Comprehensive Clinical Assessment (CCA)</h3>
                            <p>A comprehensive clinical assessment is an intensive clinical and functional face-to-face evaluation of a beneficiary’s presenting mental health, developmental disability, and substance use disorder. This assessment results in the issuance of a written report that provides the clinical basis for the development of the beneficiary’s treatment or service plan. The CCA written report must be kept in the service record.<br><br></p>

                            <h3>When a CCA is required</h3>
                            <p>According to 10A NCAC 27G .0205(a), a comprehensive clinical assessment that demonstrates medical necessity must be completed by a licensed professional prior to provision of outpatient therapy services, including individual, family and group therapy. The clinician may complete the CCA upon admission or update a recent CCA from another clinician if a substantially equivalent assessment is available and reflects the current level of functioning. Information from that assessment may be utilized as a part of the current comprehensive clinical assessment. Relevant diagnostic information must be obtained and be included in the treatment or service plan.</p>

                            Community Living and Support enables the person to learn new skills, practice and/or improve existing skills. Areas of skill acquisition are: interpersonal, independent living, community living, self-care, and self-determination.<br><br>

The technical assistance is incidental to the provision of Community Living and Supports.<br><br></p>

                            <h3>Exceptional Needs:</h3>
                            <p>Community Living and Supports Exceptional Needs are used to meet exceptional, short term situations that require services beyond 12 hours per day. The Individual Support Plan documents the exceptional supports needed based on the SIS® or other assessments that explain the nature of the issue and the expected intervention. A plan to transition the individual to sustainable supports is required. The plan may document the use of assistive technology or home modifications to reduce the amount of the support for behavioral and/or safety issues. Medical, behavioral, and support issues require documentation of when the situation is expected to resolve, evaluations/assessments needed to assist in resolving issues, and other service options explored. EPSDT and other appropriate State Plan services must always be utilized before waiver services are provided.

                            All Requests for Community Living and Supports require prior approval by the PIHP.</p>
                            <ul>

                            <li>b. Requests for up to 16 hours daily may be authorized for a six-month timeframe, within the plan year.</li>

In situations requiring an authorization beyond the initial 90-day period, the PIHP shall approve such authorization based on review of the transition plan that details the transition of the participant from Community Living and Supports to other appropriate services. The service may be provided in the home or community. The involvement of unpaid supports in the generalization of the service is an important aspect to ensure that achieved goals are practiced and maintained. Services may be allowed in the private home of the provider or staff of an Employer of Record at the discretion and agreement of the support team and when consistent with the ISP goals. </li>

Community Navigator Services may be intermittent and fade as community connections develop and skills increase in individual direction. Community Navigators assist and support (rather than direct and manage) the individual throughout the service delivery process. Community Navigator Services are intended to enhance, not replace, existing natural and community resources. If the individual requires paid supports to participate or engage once connected with the activity, Community Networking is the appropriate service to utilize to refer and link the individual.<br><br>

                            Community Networking services provide individualized day activities that support the waiver beneficiary’s definition of a meaningful day in an integrated community setting, with persons who are not disabled.

                            The Comprehensive Crisis Plan must be updated as warranted in collaboration with the team within 14 days of a crisis, in an effort to ensure it meets the individual’s needs and is reflective of anything learned from the crisis.<br><br></p>

                            <h3>Crisis Intervention & Stabilization Supports</h3>
                            <p><strong>Staff trained in Crisis Services Competencies is available to provide “first response” crisis services to individuals they support, in the event of a crisis. These activities are:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                            <li>a. Assess the nature of the crisis to determine whether the situation can be stabilized in the current location or if a higher-level intervention is needed </li>
                            <li>b. Determine and contact agencies needed to secure higher level intervention or out-of-home services</li>
                            <li>c. Provide direction to staff present at the crisis or provide direct intervention to de-escalate behavior or protect others living with the individual during behavioral or medical episodes.</li>
                            <li>d. Contact the care coordinator within 48 hours following the intervention to arrange for a treatment team meeting for the individual and/or provide direction to service providers who may be supporting the individual in day programming and community settings, such as direct intervention to de-escalate behavior or protect others during behavioral episodes. This may consist of enhanced staffing provided by a QP to provide one additional staff person in settings where the participant may be receiving other services.</li>
