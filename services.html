                                    <p>The Intensive In-Home (IIH) service is a team approach designed to address the identified needs of children and adolescents who, due to serious and chronic symptoms of an emotional, behavioral, or substance use disorder, are unable to remain stable in the community without intensive interventions.<br><br>

                                    This service may only be provided to beneficiaries through age 20. This medically necessary service directly addresses the beneficiary’s mental health or substance use disorder diagnostic and clinical needs. The needs are evidenced by the presence of a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disturbance (as defined by DSM-5, or any subsequent editions of this reference material), with documentation of symptoms and effects reflected in the Comprehensive Clinical Assessment and the Person-Centered Plan (PCP). This team provides a variety of clinical rehabilitative interventions available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, 365 days per year.<br><br>

                                    This is a time-limited, intensive child and family intervention based on the clinical needs of the beneficiary. The service is intended to accomplish the following:<br>

                                        <ul style="-webkit-padding-start: inherit;">
                                            <li>a.   reduce presenting psychiatric or substance use disorder symptoms;</li>

                                            <li>c.   ensure linkage to community services and resources; and</li>
                                            <li>d.   prevent out of home placement for the beneficiary.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                    IIH services are delivered to children and adolescents, primarily in their living environments, with a family focus, and IHH services include but are not limited to the following interventions as clinically indicated:<br><br>

The clinician may complete the CCA upon admission or update a recent CCA from another clinician if a substantially equivalent assessment is available and reflects the current level of functioning. Information from that assessment may be utilized as a part of the current comprehensive clinical assessment.

                                        Community Living and Support is an individualized service that enables the waiver beneficiary to live successfully in his/her own home, the home of his/her family or natural supports and be an active member of his/her community. A paraprofessional assists the person to learn new skills and/or supports the person in activities that are individualized and aligned with the person’s preferences. The intended outcome of the service is to increase or maintain the person’s life skills or provide the supervision needed to empower the person to live in the home of his/her family or natural supports, maximize his or her self-sufficiency, increase self- determination and enhance the person’s opportunity to have full membership in his/her community.<br><br>

                                        Community Living and Support enables the person to learn new skills, practice and/or improve existing skills. Areas of skill acquisition are: interpersonal, independent living, community living, self-care, and self-determination.<br><br>

                                        Community Living and Support provides supervision and assistance for the person to complete an activity to his/her level of independence. Areas of support consist of assistance in monitoring a health condition, nutrition or physical condition, incidental supervision, daily living skills, community participation, and interpersonal skills.<br><br>

                                        Community Living and Support provides technical assistance to unpaid supports who live in the home of the individual to assist the individual to maintain the skills they have learned. This assistance can be requested by the unpaid support or suggested by the Individual Support Planning team and must be a collaborative decision. The technical assistance is incidental to the provision of Community Living and Supports.

                                        Community Living and Supports Exceptional Needs are used to meet exceptional, short term situations 
                                        that require services beyond 12 hours per day. The Individual Support Plan documents the exceptional supports needed based on the SIS® or other assessments that explain the nature of the issue and the expected intervention. A plan to transition the individual to sustainable supports is required. The plan may document the use of assistive technology or home modifications to reduce the amount of the support for behavioral and/or safety issues. Medical, behavioral, and support issues require documentation of when the situation is expected to resolve, evaluations/assessments needed to assist in resolving issues, and other service options explored. EPSDT and other appropriate State Plan services must always be utilized before waiver services are provided.<br><br>

Services may be allowed in the private home of the provider or staff of an Employer of Record at the discretion and agreement of the support team and when consistent with the ISP goals.</p>

Community Navigator provides support to individuals and planning teams in developing social networks and connections within local communities. Community Navigator Services also emphasizes, promotes and coordinates the use of generic resources to address the individual’s needs in addition to paid services. Community Navigator provides an annual informational session on Self-Determination and Self Direction. Individuals and legally responsible persons may choose to opt out of this requirement. These services also support individuals, representatives, and Managing Employers by providing assistance to those that direct their own waiver services.<br><br>

                                    Community Navigator is mandatory for all Employers of Record until competence in directing service is demonstrated. Community Navigator Services may be intermittent and fade as community connections develop and skills increase in individual direction. Community Navigators assist and support (rather than direct and manage) the individual throughout the service delivery process. Community Navigator Services are intended to enhance, not replace, existing natural and community resources. If the individual requires paid supports to participate or engage once connected with the activity, Community Networking is the appropriate service to utilize to refer and link the individual.</p>

These services do not take place in licensed facilities and are intended to offer the beneficiary the opportunity to develop meaningful community relationships with non-disabled individuals. Services are designed to promote maximum participation in community life while developing natural supports within integrated settings. Community Networking services enable the beneficiary to increase or maintain their capacity for independence and develop social roles valued by non-disabled members of the community.
